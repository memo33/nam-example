      Network Widening Mod adds 13 surface network extensions, including 6 single-tile, 5 dual-tile, and 2 triple-tile networks.  Among these networks are the Turning Lane Avenues (with center turn lane/flush median), Medianless Avenues
 and additional widths of the One-Way Road network. It also includes diagonal/curving functionality for all networks, a series of Wide-Radius Curve pieces
 for three of the single-tile networks, transition pieces, and neighbor connector puzzle pieces for selected networks.  The updates in Version 2.0
 include the addition of the long-awaited triple-tile 6-lane Avenue and 7-lane Turning Lane Avenue.<br>

		<p class="text_zwischentitel">Features new to Version 2.0.0:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="text_normal">Three new networks have been added, including the triple-tile 6-lane Avenue and 7-lane Turning Lane Avenue, plus the single-tile 4-lane Narrow Medianless Avenue</li>
          <li class="text_normal">Draggable transition functionality, allowing easier connections with default networks, other NWM networks, and networks in the RealHighway addon (downloaded separately).</li>
		  <li class="text_normal">Basic diagonal and curving functionality for dual-tile and triple-tile networks (note: this does not include intersections).</li>
		  <li class="text_normal">Numerous new T-intersections, including dual-tile networks ending at single-tile networks.</li>
		  <li class="text_normal">Limited support for diagonal intersections on single-tile networks--this functionality is still experimental and offered on an "as-is" basis.</li>
		  <li class="text_normal">To avoid graphical glitches with some graphics cards, the grass/sidewalk wealthification on some NWM Transition Puzzle Pieces has been taken out of
		  the NWM Core and moved into an optional plugin, the NWM Legacy Transition Puzzle Piece Wealthing file.  If you are experiencing graphical glitches with this plugin (such as artifacting),
		  your graphics card cannot support this functionality, and the only way to fix it at the present is to remove this file (NetworkWideningMod_LegacyPuzzleWealthing.dat)</li>		  
        </ul>
		
		<p class="text_zwischentitel">Features new to Version 1.1.1:</p>

	Once the NWM starter puzzle piece has been plopped, you can drag the
	network using either the Road network tool (A through I) or the One-Way Road network tool
	(J through M), starting at the end of the piece.  The puzzle piece itself does not drag. 
	<span class="red">PLEASE NOTE:
	None of the NWM networks are Avenue-based.  Attempting to drag a network out with an Avenue will have no effect.  Because

Traffic Plugin one has installed. Capacity is generally calculated on a
per tile basis by the game.  All NWM
 networks are also surface street-type networks, meaning that they allow full access to
 RCI Zones. The capacities for the five standard capacity levels of the NAM Traffic Plugin are listed below.  Please note that these
 capacities listed are for the full width of the network, rather than the per-tile capacity.</p>

 <p class="text_zwischentitel" align="justify">D. Transitions</p>
 
    <p align="justify">The NWM includes the ability to transition from NWM networks to default networks, other NWM networks, and RealHighway networks, with both draggable and puzzle piece-based
	options.</p>  
	<br>
	<p align="justify">The draggable transition functionality is new to NWM Version 2.0, and these transitions can be generated in one of two ways--"Double Stub" or "Direct Connect".
	"Double Stub" transitions are built by placing the stubs of two networks back-to-back (shown below), and this technique is used for transitions between two networks of the same base (Road or One-Way Road).  The following
	transitions are built in this manner:<br><br>

Road-based NWM networks, though the five Road-based multi-tile networks (TLA-5,
MAVE-4, MAVE-6, TLA-7, AVE-6) require the use of special Neighbor Connector pieces in order to provide
proper functionality.<br>
        <br>
        In order to build a neighbor connection for one of these networks, simply build the
        neighbor connection as normal by dragging the Road tool to the edge of the city tile, then
        place the appropriate Neighbor Connector for the network over top of the neighbor connection
        arrows (please note that unlike Avenues and Maxis Highways, all the default yellow Neighbor Connection arrows will be pointed the same direction).  
		The Neighbor Connector pieces have special pathing that gets around the game's
        limitations on neighbor connections.  Note that the game's default Neighbor Connection arrows will not change direction, nor
		do they need to in order for the connection to function with the connector pieces.</p>

      <p align="justify">With the single-tile Road-based networks, neighbor connections may be built

      One-Way Road-based networks cannot create neighbor connections, much like their base network.</p>

        <p><span class="text_zwischentitel">1. Why use the Road tool to make the dual-tile
        two-way NWM networks?</span><br>
          <br>
          The Avenue network has less flexibility and there are substantial difficulties in
          making the sort of puzzle-drag overrides that are required by this project with that network.  Additionally, it would
		  cause complications with the triple-tile networks.<br>
          <br>
          <span class="text_zwischentitel">2. I am only getting Freight Traffic through my NWM Neighbor Connections. Is there any way to fix this?</span><br><br>
          Yes. This issue occurs with the two-tile Road-based networks (TLA-5, MAVE-4 and MAVE-6), and to a lesser extent, with the two triple-tile networks (TLA-7, AVE-6).
          To solve the problem, simply locate the Neighbor Connection puzzle pieces (under the NWM
          Neighbor Connection Puzzle Pieces button) and place the appropriate piece for the network at the
          edge of the city tile.
          <br><br>
          <span class="text_zwischentitel">3. Are Tunnels and Bridges possible?</span><br>
          <br>
          Bridges are not possible in Version 2.0, but the possibility exists for future Bridge functionality.  In the meantime, convert
          to a Maxis network (Road, One-Way Road or Avenue) to make a bridge.
          As far as the tunnel issue, the answer is no. Tunnel functionality is largely hardcoded
in the .EXE. Use the draggable transitions or transition puzzle pieces to switch your NWM network to a Maxis network (Road, One-Way Road or
 Avenue) that supports tunnels.<br>
          <span class="text_zwischentitel"><br>
            4. Why is traffic zig-zagging on my TLAs and dual-tile One-Way Roads?</span><br>
          <br>
          The TLA networks include a series of "crossover" paths that allow them to function
          just like roads with two-way center left turn lanes do in real-life.  The game's automata engine
          likes to explore all available paths, and as such, it will generally route some vehicles onto
          the turn crossover paths.  The wider One-Ways also have "crossover" paths that allows
          traffic to switch between the two tiles of the network, and this can occasionally cause automata
          to zigzag or do "donuts" in the middle of the road, and due to the .exe-controlled tidal flow system on One-Way Road networks, this cannot be corrected.<br>
          <span class="text_zwischentitel"><br>
            5. My NWM networks are getting congested awfully early. What is the
problem?</span><br>
          <br>
          You most likely have an incompatible Maxis-based Simulator residing in your Plugins folder.  Locate and remove it, and install one of the
NAM Unified Traffic Simulator (UTS)/Simulator Z options included in the NAM or through the Traffic System Configuration Tool (TSCT),
available separately.  <br>
          <span class="text_zwischentitel"><br>
		 	6. Is this mod compatible with the NAM Road Turning Lanes (RTL) Plugin and/or the
		 	NAM One-Way Road Arrow Reduction Plugin (ARP)?</span><br>
		 <br>Yes, it is compatible with both.  With the RTL Plugin, there may be some minor instabilities with it at NWM/Road intersections, but in most situations, it should work
		 fine.  With regards to the ARP, while the NWM allows for the overriding of OWRs built with the ARP installed, at this time, the resultant NWM OWRs may not have their arrows hidden or otherwise reduced.<br>
		 <br>
		 <span class="text_zwischentitel">7. How come when zoning, the pavement on some of the puzzle pieces is on the wrong side?</span><br>
		 <br>
		 <em>This issue only occurs with the optional Legacy Puzzle Piece Wealthing file installed.</em>  This occurs due to the way the wealthing is set-up. To rectify this problem simply zone Medium/High Density Residential or Commercial adjacent to the puzzle piece.

          <br>
          There have been significant improvements to UDI Snap To Roads functionality that previously
		  affected the Turning Lane Avenues (TLA-3 and TLA-5) in the Version 1.1.1 release.  While there are some rare
		  instances where the previous "turn and exit" behavior can still occur (mainly near starter stubs), things are 
		  much more stable than before.  If you are still running into this issue, ensure that you have removed any and all
		  files from previous NWM versions (Version 1.1.0 or earlier).<br><br>
		  
		<span class="text_zwischentitel">9. How can I curve the dual-tile networks like the TLA-5 and MAVE-6?</span><br><br>
          All NWM networks have curve/diagonal functionality in NWM Version 2.0.<br>
		  The MAVE-4 and OWR-4 operate on a "shared-tile" setup.  Here is how the base layout (without the overrides) looks for a shared-tile setup:<br><br>
		  <p align="center"><img src="images/diag1.jpg"><br><br></p>
		  The TLA-5, OWR-5 and MAVE-6 operate on a "split tile" setup.  here is how the base layout (without the overrides) looks for a split-tile setup:<br><br>
		  <p align="center"><img src="images/diag2.jpg"><br><br></p>
		  The TLA-7 and AVE-6 operate on a slightly larger "split tile setup":<br><br>

		<span class="text_zwischentitel">10. I'm trying to build diagonal intersections with my NWM networks and they're deconverting to Road or One-Way Road.  What's wrong?</span><br><br>
          Nothing--the type of intersection you're attempting to build is not supported yet.  While select single-tile diagonal intersections are offered on an experimental basis in NWM Version 2.0,
		  the dual and triple-tile NWM networks do not support any diagonal intersection capability.  Diagonal intersection capability will be expanded in future NWM releases.  Additionally, some setups
		  may simply be unstable due to the complexity of their RULs.  Try clicking around the vicinity with a network tool to see if it resolves correctly.
		  <br>
          <br>
		<span class="text_zwischentitel">11. Why are there no traffic signals on my NWM One-Way Road networks?</span><br><br>
          The game does not provide proper stop point functionality along draggable stretches of One-Way Road networks (an .exe-based limitation), which effectively causes the lights
		  to get stuck on green.  Additionally, since the Type21 exemplars used to place the signal props at the intersections cannot detect the direction of travel on the One-Way Road,
		  so the signals would end up facing the wrong direction half the time.  If you notice closely with the default 2-lane One-Way Roads included in the game, you'll notice they
		  also lack signalization on the OWR approaches, for these very same reasons.<br>
          <br>
        <span class="text_zwischentitel">12. When is the next version coming out?</span><br><br>
          We have no idea. And besides, we like to surprise people. ;-)<br>

Installation:</b>
Double-click the installer file to start the installation. The program
will guide you through the process. You can change the default
installation path, but we strongly suggest to keep the standard folder
in order to make future updates and additions easier.</p>

      <p class="text_normal"><b>MAC Users: </b>Use the manual install .zip file (labeled Network Widening Mod MacOS).
	  The following files are required:</p>
	  <ul class="text_normal">
	  <li>NetworkWideningMod.dat</li>
	  <li>NetworkWideningMod_LotSupport.dat</li>
	  <li>/Locale Files (folder)</li>

	  <p class="text_normal">For Left-Hand Drive versions of the game (on which vehicles drive on the left, such as the UK and Japanese versions of SC4), 
	  the following folder is required (failure to install can result in <em>any NWM/Rail crossing</em> ceasing to function):</p>
	  <ul class="text_normal">
	  <li>/z_Left Hand Version Plugin (folder)</li>
	  </ul>

      <p class="text_normal" align="justify"><b>Un-Installing:
      </b> To
un-install the files, simply bulldoze every Network Widening Mod network and component from this
download in your cities and delete the files from the plugins folder
afterwards.  <span class="red">Do not, under any circumstances, move the uninstaller and attempt to run it from another directory.</span></p>      </td>
